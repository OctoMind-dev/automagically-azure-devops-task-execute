# automagically-azure-devops-execute

This is a Azure DevOps Task to execute your automagically-maintained e2e tests.
To use this action a token is required. Don't have one? We're here to help.

> drop us a note: contact@octomind.dev üêô

## Setup

1. Add the `AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN` to your repository secrets
2. Add the following yml snippet to your pipeline and insert a value for `url` pointing to a publicly accessible
   deployment of your branch.

```yml
- task: automagically-execute@1
  inputs:
    url:
    token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN }}
```

## Publishing notes

There is currently no way to publish without a personal access token. It currently is relying
on [Germandrummer92](https://github.com/Germandrummer92)'s PAT.
You currently need to bump both the task.json AND vss-extension.json versions to publish a new version.

TFX-cli does not support pnpm-style symlink-based node_module symlinks, see
